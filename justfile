# Sync the dev environment and install the coverage subprocess startup hook.
# The hook is the canonical mechanism (per coverage.py docs) for measuring
# import-time code that pytest-cov would otherwise miss because the package is
# imported during pytest plugin discovery, before instrumentation starts.
# Idempotent: rewrites the .pth file each run because `uv sync --frozen` may
# rebuild the venv from scratch.
setup:
    uv sync --frozen --all-extras --group dev
    @uv run python -c "import sysconfig, pathlib; \
        p = pathlib.Path(sysconfig.get_paths()['purelib']) / 'coverage_subprocess.pth'; \
        p.write_text('import coverage; coverage.process_startup()\n'); \
        print(f'Installed coverage subprocess hook at {p}')"

# Run the full pytest suite under coverage.
# COVERAGE_PROCESS_START activates the coverage_subprocess.pth hook (installed
# by `just setup`), which starts coverage at Python interpreter startup so
# import-time class/function definitions are measured even when pytest-cov
# imports `litestar_pagination` early during plugin discovery.
